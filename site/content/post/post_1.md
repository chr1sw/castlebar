  Yesterday Crude Oil started the day off on the defensive. DOE statistics showed inventory levels with a build of 2.5 million barrels, in contrast to average expectations of drawdowns from 1.1 to 1.9. Prices were lower in choppy activity and ultimately accelerated to the downside late in the day.

The market sliced through supports, making a new low since April, but not quite breaking the March front month lows of 48.71.  Runs were marginally higher. WTI/Brent continued to widen to a low of -6.94, coming close to the -700-732 band of support. The narrowing last month to -300 attracted West African cargos into the US, correcting that spread, widening it back out. There was also reported some chaos at Nigerian ports as the President reportedly turned away 113 vessels, supposedly to crack down on unauthorized trade, though I have no detailed information on that. Imports are now averaging 7.5 million barrels per day over the last 4 weeks, up 2.5%. WTI/LLS weakened to a differential of -405. Open interest and volume statistics showed a shift: on lower price activity, the net liquidating trend has ended and volume accelerated. We expect an acceleration of the down move in WTI to test spot March lows of 48.71.  

The Federal Highway administration showed that lower gasoline prices translated into more driving. Street and highway travel rose in May by 2.7 percent from a year ago to 275.1 billion vehicle miles, The mileage is the most recorded in a single month since 1990, when the agency started tracking the data. The seasonally-adjusted vehicle miles traveled for May 2015 rose 3.4 percent to 262.1 billion miles. It represents a 0.2 percent rise from April. The greatest increase in driving was seen in the South-Atlantic states.

**Heating Oil**

Today, the complex laggard, Heating Oil spreads corrected sharply. The DOEs showed a build of 1.68 mb, but all intramarket and crack spreads tightened, correcting after extended weakness.
